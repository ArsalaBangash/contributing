Guidelines for people contributing to dwyl projects

Firstly, a ***heartfelt thankyou*** for even *considering* contributing to the dwyl project!
We rely on contributions from *many* ***fantastic people*** to make dwyl a reality
and are *excited* that you are reading this in order to join the fun!

We (dwyl) are building our company using the open source code others have published
and consequently we think its *only fair* that everything we make is also open source.

We are releasing our work under the GNU General Public License Version 2 (GPL V.2)
if you have any questions regarding the license, please read:
https://github.com/dwyl/intellectual-property and raise an
[issue](https://github.com/dwyl/intellectual-property/issues)
on GitHub if you require clarification!

See: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/1 + https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/27

## Recommended Guidelines

### Labels

GitHub can be a _great_ project management tool if used _effectively_. One of the ways you can manage your project backlog is through **labels**. Labels are a great way to **organise** and **track** the progress of a given project at _any_ point in time.

At dwyl we have created our _own_ standard list of labels that we use for each of our projects. This gives our developers the ability to move between projects **quickly** and **productively**, saving time and energy in the process.

Here is our **[complete list](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/labels)** of labels and how they should be used:
