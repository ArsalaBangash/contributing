## Got a Security/Privacy Concern or Question?
If you have a [***security/privacy***](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-security)
_related question_ that you want to ask or ***disclose privately***, <br />
**_please_ email** us:
[**hello+security@dwyl.io**](mailto:hello+security@dwyl.io) <br />
_For **all other questions/ideas/issues, please follow** the **steps below**_.
<br /><br />

![i m new](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22239494/b6caf0e6-e20e-11e6-95d8-ad4275311c89.jpg)


# _New_ To The Project?

### Step 1: Check if the Idea/Story/Issue _Already Exists_ Using GitHub Search ![search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224334/255930a8-e1b6-11e6-9953-12cd4739aa1c.png)

1. Please take a minute to ***read through the existing stories/issues***
for the project to familiarize yourself with the current "backlog".

1. Try ***searching*** through the ***existing issues***
for _keywords_ associated with the story/issue you want to create, <br />
e.g:
https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20app+icon <br/>
if `"app icon"` were your keywords and you're searching in the "**Time**" project.

![issue-matching-keyword-search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22225715/852d9f78-e1bb-11e6-9d20-37492da92dc1.png)
1. if you ***find*** an _existing_ issue that matches what you were looking for,
_please_ click on the title of the issue, ***read the description*** to
confirm if it's what you are looking for, then ***comment*** on it
so we know more than one person has the need/issue.

![issue-search-for-app-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24758860/22225508/993c7ecc-e1ba-11e6-8a53-e8d2ac398546.png)
1. Otherwise, if you are (_reasonably_) sure there is no _existing_ issue/story
covering what you have in mind, _please_ create a new issue (_see next step_!)


### Step 2: Create a New User Story _or_ Report an Issue ![New Issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224203/bbc5efb4-e1b5-11e6-9fcb-3aae75ae74ed.png)

1. Using the `New Issue` button, create an issue for the user story or issue
  you have in mind.

  + A _good_ user story _describes_ the idea
  in a _**concise** and **user-focussed**_ way. <br />
  Example user story (_if the feature has not been described before_):
  ```
  As a person using the Web App
  I want to be able to save a shortcut app icon to my home screen
  so that I can easily get back into the app without having to navigate to it.
  ```
  or if you are reporting an issue/bug/fault try and include
  the exact steps to "_reproduce_" the issue. <br />
  example:
  ```
  when using the app on an iPhone 6 running the latest OS (10.2)
  when I attempt to save a shortcut to my home screen,
  I do not see an app icon. :-(
  ```
  + Please *include* as much ***relevant information*** as you can
  so the Product Owner (_or project leader_) can decide if
  it is a necessary/desired feature.
  Example of useful details:
  ```
  People using the app will only access the app from their company-issued
  Android (Lollipop) Mobile phone (5 inch Samsung Galaxy J)
  The screen resolution is 1080 x 1920 pixels
  ```
  or describing a specific need for "_offline capability_"
  ```
  People use the app in areas with poor mobile signal
  so the app has to work offline and sync data/changes later
  when they are back on WiFi or 3G.
  ```
  or for a when reporting an issue (_potential bug_):
  ```
  People using Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 report that
  they cannot click on the button to save their app preferences/settings.
  ```

> ***Tip***: _if you **can upload** a_ ***sketch*** (_of the idea_) or
***screenshot*** (_of the issue_), it helps _clarify_ a lot! <br />
> ***How to take screenshot***: http://www.take-a-screenshot.org
(_all platforms_!)

Example creating a **New Issue** with a ***clear description***
and **_illustrative_ screenshots**:

[![create-issue-for-home-screen-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24758860/22227322/ae12d9f6-e1c2-11e6-928c-c20cfe8b3912.png)](https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues/194)

This is a _real_ issue: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues/194
if you want to see how it was _resolved_, click and go check it out!

### Step 3: Submit the _New Issue_!

+ Once you _submit_ a new issue for a User Story or Issue/Bug a member
of the team (_typically the Product Owner_) will ***review*** the issue.

+ That's _it_ from the side of the _issue_ creator!

## Questions?

####¬†How _Long_ Does it take for an Issue to be _Reviewed_?

We ***aim*** to respond to new issues within _**minutes**_
but during busy work days this can take up to ***a few hours***... <br />
(_**thank you** for your **patience**!_)

![thinking-please-wait](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22228969/9add48f8-e1cc-11e6-8cdc-ef9b30eac846.jpg)

####¬†What can I do `while` I _wait_ for a _reply_?

+ If you are ***itching*** to help "move the issue/story along"
you can help by _describing_ how the story/issue _could_
be implemented or "_fixed_" ... feel free to ***describe your thoughts***
in a **_follow-up_ comment** on the issue you _just_ created!

+ **_Please_ do not write _any_ code _until_**
the story/issue/bug has been ***verified***
(_by the product owner or project lead_). <br />
(_It's not that we "doubt" anyone's abilities or the validity of ideas/issues
we simply don't want people "wasting time" or "duplicating effort"
on un-verified issues...
also there are **many** other ways you can help `while` you wait..._)

![what-to-do-while-waiting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22229403/5a08474e-e1cf-11e6-8c1f-858f3a167315.jpg)

> To help us **a lot**: go on a treasure hunt for an issue <br />
that _someone else_ created which has not had any comments ... <br />
or has not been _assigned_ to someone for investigation/work. <br />
this is quite easy to find by searching for a **label**:
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Adwyl+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

<br /><br /><br />

# _Next_?

## A _Different_ Team Member _Must Verify_ the User Story/Issue

### Step 4: _Confirming_ the Need in the New Story/Issue

1. When a new issue (_user story, feature request or potential bug_)
is submitted by someone, we _require_ a _different_ person to verify it. <br />
_Typically_ this verification of need
is done by the "_Product Owner_" ("**PO**")
or the "_Project Leader_" ("**PL**"),
but in the case that the issue was _created_ by the PO/PL then a _different_
member of the team will need to _confirm_ their _understanding_ of the issue.

1. The person acknowledging the user story will add some **labels** to
the issue to help ***categorise*** it. eg. `question`, `discuss`, etc.

1. (_More_) Labels can always be added/removed at any time. The purpose of
labels is to help the team categorize and prioritize issues in the backlog see:
[complete list of labels](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/labels)

### Step 5: Assigning _Priority_ to the Story/Issue

+ ***Always ensure*** that the Story/Issue focusses on ***only one thing***.
As soon as you see the word "***and***" in a story/issue, you know it is
trying to do more than one thing.
+ ***If*** the Story/Issue has **too many components or features***,
  split the user story into "***sub-stories***"
  (_often reffered to as "**sub-tasks**"_)
  which you **link** to from the "main" story/issue.
  `-> Example of a Larger Story ("Epic") with Linked Sub-stories Required!`
  see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/55
+ Product owner (or Project Maintainer) will add a
  priority label e.g: `Priority-2` to the story/issue.
+ Any/all Sub-Stories should _also_ be prioritized so that the team
can determine the _order_ in which they need to be worked on.
+ During "_Sprint Planning_" a ***time estimate label*** is added
  to each story (_and Sub-Stories/tasks_)
  The time estimate _must_ include time to:
  + ***document***
  + ***test***
  + ***develop*** and
  + ***deliver***
+ Where ever possible/practical/relevant **include** the person who
**_originally_ created the story/issue** in the time estimation discussion.
+ For work in sprints, a **milestone** is added **at the sprint planning
session** to group the user stories with its relevant sprint;
this gives _everyone_ in the team a **_clear_ picture** of what is ***planned***.

### Step 6: Do the Work!

![get-it-done](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22265743/44a2ca72-e275-11e6-819d-2c5a1958ea11.png)

Once _all_ the previous steps have been performed
(_story/issue created, categorized with labels, any sub-stories/tasks
  created and estimate label applied_)

1. ***Assign*** the story/issue to yourself _before_ you start working.

2. ***Apply*** the `in-progress` **label** to the story/issue/sub-task so
  that your team knows when work started
  and that it is ***currently*** being worked.

3. ***Update*** the `README.md` ***before*** working on the task:
  _Ensuring_ you answer the questions: ***Why? What? How?***
  > This is referred to as
  ["***Readme Driven Development***"](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
  i.e: you ***document*** your work
  ***before*** you write ***any code***. <br />
  (_if this feels "tedious" to you, ask yourself
  remind yourself of the last time you
  "**inherited**" **undocumented code**..._) <br />
  **Watch**: ["**_The Mess_ We're In**" by Joe Armstrong](https://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4?t=8m56s)
4. ***Log*** progress as
  [_comments in the issue_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch/issues/8
  you are working on to keep everyone informed along
  the way (**_this allows people to help you more effectively and gives
    your client something measurable_**).
  + If you _haven't finished_ your current task by the end of the day,
  take **5 minutes** to **_describe_ the progress** you've made
  and what else (_still_) needs to be done - _anyone_ should be able
  to pick up and complete a user story by reading this description.
  + If you are leaving for more than a day,
  ***remove*** the `in-pogress` **label**
  and ***un-assign yourself*** form the story.

5. ***Reference*** the **user story/issue/sub-task** you are working on
  by pasting a link to the GitHub issue
  in the **commit message**.

6. Once you have _commited_ your work/progessy, push up your changes
  and then open a Pull Rrequest _(even if the work isn't yet finished)_ <br />
  so that the rest of your team can easily see what you've been working on.
  (_rem)
  + Add `[WiP]` before the title of your PR and add that it's
  **NOT READY FOR REVIEW** in the description if it's still in progress.

### Step 7. _Prepare_ your Pull Request for Review

1. Make sure ***all tests*** are **passing**
  and (_where applicable_) that your **code coverage** is ***100%***.
  + ***Never*** _comment_ out a test that is failing.
  (_Don't laugh, we have seen "**cowboy developers**" do this...!
  If a test is failing, the feature is broken!
  Fix the feature to make the test pass. Only then is your work "**done**"_)
+ Increment the version of your application if it is a "_new release_".
+ Remove the `[WiP]` from your PR title and change the description to **READY FOR REVIEW**
+ Make sure your pull request is [ready for review](#pull-requests)
+ Assign someone to review your pull request
+ Delete the `in-progress` label and _add an `in-review` label_
+ Update the time label if necessary

_These guidelines for creating user stories are an adaptation of [Simon's](https://github.com/simonlab) [**user-story-checklist**](https://github.com/SimonLab/user-story-checklist) repo. Check it out!_

### Pull Requests

At dwyl we like to work in the most ***agile*** way possible.
This extends to how we submit and review our **pull requests**.

> **Rule**: _**One thing** (feature or bug fix) **per pull request**_.

You might be _tempted_, to bundle up _several_ bug fixes/feature additions into
one _large_ PR and then submit it to be reviewed all at once.
We prefer working in _smaller increments_ splitting the work
into individual parts to be reviewed separately. The reasons are:

+ It allows us to keep track of the work more easily because it provides more
_descriptive_ reference points
("[_paper trail_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paper_trail)")
to which we can look back at in future if required
+ It gives the person reviewing the PR a single focus for the change/bug-fix
which improves review speed.

> Further reading: "Working in Small Batches":  http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/02/work-in-small-batches.html

+ **When you submit your pull request, include:**
  + A **descriptive title** that answers the question "What does this PR do?"
  + A reference to the issue that the PR solves
  + An explanation of what the PR includes (**bullet pointed lists** are sometimes helpful to make things clearer) and the _implementation detail_
  + An **update to the documentation** (often the repo's readme)
  + Make sure your PR **adds tests** for the new code you have written
  + If you have the permissions to do so, **assign your pull request** to someone for review (this person will be the first point of contact if the PR merges a bug into the production environment)

A good example is this one: https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/pull/12 ((created from the need which was confirmed in [this issue](https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/issues/10))).

#### Images and Binary Files

When making a pull request, make sure that you haven't included
any ***unnecessary*** files that will take up a lot of space in the project!

Such files include images and other binary files like dependencies or drivers.
Git is meant for source code and other (_text-based_)
files that require version control.
Images and other binary files are difficult for a human to review
in a GitHub Pull Request and just take up a huge amount of space!
This means that when ever a person clones/pulls the code they have to _download_ many/huge files (_not just the code which is typically tiny by comparison_)

> It is a _general_ `git` "_best practice_" to avoid _clogging_ up your Git repo with files that don't need to be under version control.


### Labels

GitHub can be a _great_ project management tool if used _effectively_.
One of the ways we _communicate_ with each other in our project(s)
is by using **labels** to _categorize_ the issues/stories/PRs.

Labels are a great way to **organise** and **track** the progress of a
given project at _any_ point in time. [Here's why we choose to use GitHub](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why)

At dwyl we have created our _own_ standard list of labels
that we use for each of our projects. This gives our team the ability
to move between projects **quickly** and **productively**, saving time
and energy in the process.

Here is our [**Complete List of Labels**](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/labels)
and how they should be used:

![labels](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12450298/18248682/afcd6974-7371-11e6-84bf-0cb9f4677d92.png)

Github gives you a pre-populated list of labels for you to use. They are:

- `bug` #EE0701 - report a bug that needs fixed
- `duplicate` #CCCCCC - duplicate issue
- `enhancement` #84B6EB - improving existing code
- `help-wanted` #128A0C - looking for help or expertise on a subject
- `invalid` #E6E6E6 - GitHub standard tag (not used)
- `question` #CC317C - for open questions and discussions
- `wontfix` #ffffff - when an issue won't be addressed (with reason why in comment)

Here are the custom ones that we use at dwyl:

- `in-progress` #009688 - to be added when an issue has been assigned
- `in-review` #128A0C - once a PR has been submitted relating to the issue
- `please-test` #08E700 - added after PR is merged (assign to product owner)
- `priority-1` #0D47A1 - drop everything and work on this (used only when _completely_ neccessary)
- `priority-2` #1976D2 - high priority issue (what needs doing now)
- `priority-3` #42A5F5 - high priority (what needs doing next)
- `priority-4` #8DC9F9 - low priority (to be upgraded later)
- `priority-5` #C5DEF5 - lowest priority (non-urgent changes)
- `T[x]d` #F06292 - time in 'x' days it should take (estimation)
- `T[x]h` #F7C6C7 - time in 'x' hours it should take (estimation)
- `technical` #D4C5F9 - technical issue for developers

## *What?*

### Issues

At dwyl we use _issues_ to log our user stories and technical tasks to ensure we have a [single version of the truth](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why).  
User stories describe features of the application in terms of their value to the *user*.

### Issues > Validation

This may feel a bit "_bureaucratic_" but (_we find that on balance_) it makes for better remote working because less discussion is "lost" and means everyone can follow along regardless of their location.
